# Deduplication Requirements

## Use Cases

### I do not want to see many duplicate products, because that makes it hard to pick which I need to view to get the product information I want

### I want to be warned if I am creating a duplicate entry for an ingredient or product

### I want to see if a product is flagged as a possible duplicate, and then be able to view it's associated duplicates

## Technical Requirements

### Show possible duplicates during entry creation

### Make it easy for moderators to dedupe entries
