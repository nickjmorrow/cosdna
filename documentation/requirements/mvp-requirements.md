# MVP Requirements

## Use Cases

### I want to view what ingredients are in a product so I can decide whether that product will do what I want it to do.

- view a page, \*.com/products/the-ordinary-squalane-cleanser, which shows a list of ingredients for the product
- highlight active ingredients
- able to search for a product

### I want to know what an ingredient does so that I can determine whether I want to use that ingredient in the products in my routine.

- view a page, \*.com/ingredients/squalane, which shows information about the ingredient
  - comedogenicity
  - safety
  - irritability
  - what is it used for
- able to search ingredients
- view what products use this ingredient

### I want to be able to add a product to the site if that product does not exist. Similarly, I want to associate ingredients with the product and create new ingredients if they do not yet exist.

- dedicated page for product creation
- makes it easy to associate/create-if-not-exists ingredients
- if no products/ingredients returned from search, make it obvious how to create an entry

### I want to be able to view ingredients and products based off desired outcome

- E.g. ingredients should be associated with some use, like "lightening", and if I say I want lightening, I should be able to view a list of ingredients or products associated with that use

### I want the site to be seeded with popular products so that I don't need to add my entire routine
